        ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). ASCII defined 128 different alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

        ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. 
        
        This character set supported 256 different character codes.

        ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.

        Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

        UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
